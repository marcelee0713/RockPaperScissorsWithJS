# Rock Paper Scissors with a simple UI
## I'm Back
Hello it's me Marcel. And I'm finally recovered from a terrible headache of my entire life. I can't even study, workout, eat and etc... Because of that I even got bored and lazy. If you ever wonder why there are not commits. It's because I'm **really** lazy. I don't know why, I think it's because of my terrible headache that last for 3 weeks. 

And for this project on Javascript Basics "Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors". I just made an alternative way, that I can play without making limits until 5 rounds and made a restart button instead. 

Lastly, Since I don't have my terrible headache. I will grind studying Sass, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
